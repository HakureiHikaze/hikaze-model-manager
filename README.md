- **Model Manager**: Full-featured interface with tabs for comprehensive model metadata management

### üîß Enhanced Custom Nodes
- **Checkpoint Selector**: Advanced model selection with visual feedback
- **Power LoRA Loader**: Multi-LoRA stacking with individual strength controls and bypass functionality

### üñ•Ô∏è Intelligent Backend
- **Automatic Service**: Self-starting HTTP server (default port 8789) for seamless operation
- **Smart Scanning**: Efficient model discovery and metadata extraction
- **Database Management**: Persistent storage for model information and user customizations

### üåê Multi-Language Support
- English and Chinese (Simplified) interface
- Automatic language detection with manual override options

### ‚ö° Performance Optimized
- Zero-impact plugin loading with lazy dependency imports
- Threaded backend service for responsive UI

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
   git clone https://github.com/HakureiHikaze/hikaze-model-manager.git
   ```

2. Restart ComfyUI - the plugin will automatically start its backend service

3. Access the model manager through:
   - **Right-click menu**: "Model Manager" button in the ComfyUI interface
   - **Node buttons**: "Choose Models" buttons on compatible loader nodes

## Usage

- Supports multi-selection for LoRA loaders with strength controls

### Model Management Mode
- Opened from the main ComfyUI menu button
- Full tabbed interface for comprehensive model organization
- Edit model metadata, tags, and descriptions
- Upload and manage model preview images
- No selection confirmation - changes are saved automatically

### Power LoRA Loader
- Stack multiple LoRAs with individual strength controls
- Model and CLIP inputs are required connections
- Dynamic parameter injection for flexible workflow design
- Bypass functionality for quick enable/disable

## Architecture

### Backend Service
- **HTTP Server**: RESTful API for model operations
- **Scanner Module**: Intelligent model discovery and processing  
- **Database Layer**: SQLite-based storage for model metadata
- **Configuration System**: Flexible settings management

### Frontend Interface
